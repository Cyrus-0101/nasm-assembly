- The code is divided into three sections: .data, .bss, and .text. Let's go through each section and explain the purpose of each line:

## .data Section:

- `msg1` and `len1`: Define the message to prompt for the first number and its length.
- `msg2` and `len2`: Define the message to prompt for the second number and its length.
- `msg3` and `len3`: Define the message to print the sum with a line break and its length.

## .bss Section:

- `num1`, `num2`, and `res`: Define buffers to store the first number, second number, and result, respectively. Each buffer is allocated 3 bytes of memory.

## .text Section:

- `global _start`: Declare the entry point of the program as _start.

## Prompting and Reading Numbers:

- The program prompts the user for the first number by printing the message stored in msg1 using the write system call (int 0x80).
- It reads the first number from the user and stores it in the buffer num1 using the read system call (int 0x80).
- The same process is repeated for the second number, using the msg2 message and num2 buffer.

## Converting Numbers and Calculating Sum:

- The program converts the ASCII representation of the first number to decimal by subtracting 0x3030 (hexadecimal representation of '0').
- It performs the same conversion for the second number and stores the results in the eax and ebx registers.
- The program adds the converted numbers and stores the sum in the eax register, converting it back to ASCII representation by adding 0x3030.

## Printing the Result:

- The program prints the "The sum is: " message stored in msg3 using the write system call.
- It then prints the calculated sum stored in the res buffer using the write system call.

## Printing a Line Break:

- The program prints a line break by using a single-character buffer newline containing the newline character (0xa).

## Exiting the Program:

- Finally, the program uses the exit system call to terminate the program. Below is a breakdown table

|Line |	Assembly Code |	Explanation |
